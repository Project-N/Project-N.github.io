            <h2>Donations to Project N</h2>
            <p>Our developers work on a volunteer-basis, and our projects are released freely. We do not have any funding, and we are therefore unable to publish our apps to our own domains or to the app store. Donations are highly appreciated to allow Project N to continue development on projects.</p>
